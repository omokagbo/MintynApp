With the time I have and some extra, I was able to implement some features for the app as requested in the mail sent.

The app works fine in both light and dark modes, adapting to the user's default system settings.

Settings, legal and system works to a large extent.


## WITH MORE TIME: 

- I could make the UI look better and make some minor improvements.
- Decouple the ViewControllers from each other (using coordinators or something else).
- Make use of proper and full MVVM architecture.
- Implement the light and dark mode under system settings of the app instead of only the default user settings.
- Write unit and UI tests where applicable.
- Organise my code properly.
- Instead of using images for some components, I'd actually write codes to render them out on the UI.
